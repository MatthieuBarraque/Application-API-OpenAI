#openIA Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools that use the OpenIA API. The tools are designed to be easy to use and to provide a variety of functionality.
To use the tools, you must first create a project in the OpenIA Console. You will need to create a key for your project. Once you have a key, you can add it to the .env file in the repository.

Here is an example of a .env file:

OPENIA_KEY=your-key-here

Once you have added the key to the .env file, you can run the tools by running the following command:

python [tool-name].py

For example, to run the image search tool, you would run the following command:

python image_search.py

The tools will prompt you for input. For example, the image search tool will prompt you for a search query.

The tools will return output. For example, the image search tool will return a list of images that match the search query.
